# Car Dealership 2 

## Description of the Project
This Java console application is an extension of a car dealership management system. In this phase, we added Sales and Lease functionality to simulate real dealership operations.

Purpose: Allow a dealership user (salesperson or manager) to sell or lease a vehicle to a customer, generate a contract, and automatically remove that vehicle from inventory.

Intended Users: Dealership employees using a command-line terminal to manage vehicle transactions.

Main Features:View and search vehicle inventory

- Sell or lease a vehicle based on customer input
- Generate and save a SalesContract or LeaseContract
- Automatically remove sold/leased vehicles from inventory
- Persist contracts and inventory to files



## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. 

- As a user, I want contracts to store basic customer and vehicle info so that all transactions are tracked consistently.
- As a user, I want the system to calculate total price and monthly payments based on the type of contract so that I always see the right financial details.
